🌌 2D & 3D Solar System Graphics Project
An interactive 2D and 3D graphical simulation of the Solar System, developed as part of a Computer Graphics course.
The project visualizes planetary motion, orbits, and spatial relationships, allowing users to freely explore the system using keyboard and mouse controls.
The simulation emphasizes real-time rendering, camera control, and user interaction, offering an intuitive way to observe planetary dynamics and graphical representations.

✨ Features

🔄 Dual Representation (2D & 3D)
Visualize the Solar System in both 2D and 3D modes
Seamless switching between representations for different perspectives

🪐 Planetary Motion
Continuous orbital animation around the Sun
Dynamic speed control (speed up / slow down)
Ability to pause and resume planetary motion

🎥 Camera & Navigation
Free camera movement using keyboard and mouse
Smooth rotation and zooming
Close inspection of individual planets or the entire system

🌀 Orbit Visualization
Toggleable planetary orbits
Clear visualization of orbital paths and relative distances

🎨 Rendering Modes
Multiple visualization modes for learning and debugging:
Textured view (full surface textures)
Vertex view
Wireframe / edge view

⚡ Real-Time Interaction
All interactions (camera movement, speed changes, rendering modes) are applied instantly, without restarting the simulation

🎮 Controls

🚀 Movement & Camera
W / A / S / D – Move the camera
Mouse movement – Look around
Mouse scroll – Zoom in / zoom out
Left mouse button (hold) – Focused planet details and trivia

⏱️ Simulation Control
P – Pause / resume planet movement
+ – Increase planetary speed
- – Decrease planetary speed

👁️ Visualization Options
